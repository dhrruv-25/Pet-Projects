Pet Projects 

Welcome to my pet projects. This is a place for me to show off bits of the work that I've done for people to see.

Brief descriptions:
NN.ipynb: contains an autoencoder built from scratch using numpy, and visualization using matplotlib. 
  The autoencoder takes a list of seven 0s and one 1 at varying positions, so there are eight training and testing instances.
  The main idea is to show how backpropagation/gradient descent updates the weight matrices to minimize error.

bias_variance_decomp.ipynb: contains multiple mini sections. 1.) shows how observed data may vary from true values that we're trying to predict.
  2.) The second part implements polynomial regression on linear and quadratic data.
  3.) The third part outlines how the model variance increases as the model complexity increases, while the model bias decreases.


(For employers) Although I use simple libraries here, I am also comfortable with: sklearn, SciPy, seaborn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, pandas
